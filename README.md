# About The Project
A Django-based fashion e-commerce architecture named fashion-shop-e-comm (built from an source branch like iterce-project-using-django-main or similar modular setups) uses Python's high-level framework to build a secure, highly scalable, and custom database-driven shopping experience.By breaking down the standard architectural blueprint for this specific type of project, you can see how it handles database design, features, and app modularity.
